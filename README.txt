patch dsx.asm (Dynamic Sprites Patch) from SMWCentral to your ROM with asar if you have 
not already done that with other sprites. Unless your rom is sa-1 -- sa-1 pack comes with dsx already.

put these files in your sprites directory in sprite tool:
yipiranhav3.asm
yipiranhav3.cfg
yiptooiev3.asm
yiptooiev3.cfg
piranhagfx.bin

insert the palette into your level

Feel free to report any glitches to me, SMWEdit (aka edit1754), at SMWCentral (or wherever)
