patch dsx.asm from SMWCentral to your ROM with xkas if you have not already done that with other sprites.

put these files in your sprites directory in sprite tool:
yipiranhav3.asm
yipiranhav3.cfg
yiptooiev3.asm
yiptooiev3.cfg
piranhagfx.bin

insert the palette into your level

Feel free to report any glitches to me, SMWEdit (aka edit1754), at SMWCentral (or wherever)
