Under "INIT and MAIN JSL targets", you will find these lines:


CONFIGSADDR	dcw SHOTSADDR&$FFFF,HITSADDR&$FFFF

SHOTSADDR	dcw SHOTS1&$FFFF,SHOTS2&$FFFF
HITSADDR	dcw HITS1&$FFFF,HITS2&$FFFF

SHOTS1		dcb $02 : dcb $05,$05,$02	; #shots-1, shots
HITS1		dcb $02 : dcb $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes

SHOTS2		dcb $00 : dcb $05		; #shots-1, shots
HITS2		dcb $02 : dcb $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes


This includes two preset customizations...
the default (3 shots, 3 hits), and an extra configuration (1 shot, 3 hits)



Here's how to create your own configuration:

1. Copy/paste one of the configurations, and change the numbers on the symbols.

    Ex:
        SHOTS3		dcb $00 : dcb $05		; #shots-1, shots
        HITS3		dcb $02 : dcb $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes

2. Modify the shots... The first number is the amount of shots -1.
   The remaining numbers are the angles for firing. Range: $00-$0F...
   $00 is completely vertical, and $0F is completely horizontal.

   Ex: If you want to have 4 shots, at angles $08, $06, $04, and then $02
        SHOTS3		dcb $03 : dcb $08,$06,$04,$02	; #shots-1, shots

3. Modify the HP, and palettes... The first number is amount of hits to kill -1.
   The remaining numbers are order of palettes for the head after each shot is fired.

   Ex: If you wanted it to take 5 hits to kill at palettes $0D, $0A, $0C, $0B, and then $09
	HITS2		dcb $04 : dcb $0D,$0A,$0C,$0B,$09	; #hits-1, palettes

4. Add your configuration to the list of configurations

   Ex:
	SHOTSADDR	dcw SHOTS1&$FFFF,SHOTS2&$FFFF
	HITSADDR	dcw HITS1&$FFFF,HITS2&$FFFF
   would become
	SHOTSADDR	dcw SHOTS1&$FFFF,SHOTS2&$FFFF,SHOTS3&$FFFF
	HITSADDR	dcw HITS1&$FFFF,HITS2&$FFFF,HITS3&$FFFF

5. It's time to use your new configuration
   Make a copy of yiptooiev3.cfg but NOT the ASM file. You can rename the CFG file to whatever you like.
   Open it with the CFG editor, take your configuration's number in the lists, subtract 1, and put it into the first extra property byte.
   
   Ex: If it is 3rd in the shots and hits lists, you would set 2 as the extra property byte value
