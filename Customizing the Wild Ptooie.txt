Under "INIT and MAIN JSL targets", you will find these lines:


CONFIGSADDR:	dw SHOTSADDR,HITSADDR

SHOTSADDR:	dw SHOTS1,SHOTS2
HITSADDR:	dw HITS1,HITS2

SHOTS1:		db $02 : db $05,$05,$02	; #shots-1, shots
HITS1:		db $02 : db $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes

SHOTS2:		db $00 : db $05		; #shots-1, shots
HITS2:		db $02 : db $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes


This includes two preset customizations...
the default (3 shots, 3 hits), and an extra configuration (1 shot, 3 hits)



Here's how to create your own configuration:

1. Copy/paste one of the configurations, and change the numbers on the symbols.

    Ex:
        SHOTS3:		db $00 : db $05		; #shots-1, shots
        HITS3:		db $02 : db $0D,$0A,$0C	; #hits-1, palettes

2. Modify the shots... The first number is the amount of shots -1.
   The remaining numbers are the angles for firing. Range: $00-$0F...
   $00 is completely vertical, and $0F is completely horizontal.

   Ex: If you want to have 4 shots, at angles $08, $06, $04, and then $02
        SHOTS3:		db $03 : db $08,$06,$04,$02	; #shots-1, shots

3. Modify the HP, and palettes... The first number is amount of hits to kill -1.
   The remaining numbers are order of palettes for the head after each shot is fired.

   Ex: If you wanted it to take 5 hits to kill at palettes $0D, $0A, $0C, $0B, and then $09
	HITS2:		db $04 : db $0D,$0A,$0C,$0B,$09	; #hits-1, palettes

4. Add your configuration to the list of configurations

   Ex:
	SHOTSADDR:	dw SHOTS1,SHOTS2
	HITSADDR:	dw HITS1,HITS2
   would become
	SHOTSADDR:	dw SHOTS1,SHOTS2,SHOTS3
	HITSADDR:	dw HITS1,HITS2,HITS3

5. It's time to use your new configuration
   Make a copy of yiptooiev3.cfg but NOT the ASM file. You can rename the CFG file to whatever you like.
   Open it with the CFG editor, take your configuration's number in the lists, subtract 1, and put it into the first extra property byte.
   
   Ex: If it is 3rd in the shots and hits lists, you would set 2 as the extra property byte value
